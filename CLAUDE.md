# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in this repository.

## Project

**Dusklight:** A universal UI client for arbitrary data sources. Not just read-only - includes a control plane for mutating, triggering, and interacting with the systems producing the data.

### Data Sources

Static, filesystem, network fetched/streamed, video, audio, binary, JSON, SSE, JSONL, protobuf, msgpack, etc.

### Control Plane

Dusklight is data-format agnostic, and so is its control plane. You can:
- View data from any source
- Trigger actions on the system producing the data
- Mutate state through the same protocol
- Monitor multiple systems in unified views

This makes Dusklight the "Project Hub" for RHI - viewing world state, triggering extractions, monitoring pipelines, all through format-agnostic adapters.

### Expression Language

**Marinada** (`packages/marinada`) is the core expression language and reactive computation model for Dusklight. It is not a utility library — it is the engine that powers all dynamic layout properties, data traversals, and optic bindings. Read `docs/marinada.md` before forming any opinion about it.

Key facts to anchor a new session:
- Expressions are JSON arrays (s-expressions as data); no custom parser
- Two backends: JS JIT (browser, owns reactive graph) and Rust/WASM (binary/heavy computation)
- Algebraic effects, linear types, discriminated unions — all **intentional spec features**, not overengineering
- `lib:std` (map, filter, reduce, option, result, etc.) is implemented as ordinary Marinada expressions, not hardcoded primitives
- `LayoutOptic` in `core/src/types.ts` is an `Expr` that evaluates to a Lens or Traversal at runtime

## Context Is The Only Scarce Resource

Every byte that enters the main session stays in the main session for its entire lifetime. File contents, command output, search results, page text — once read, it lingers in cache and shapes every downstream token. There is no "just looking."

**All exploration runs in subagents.** Investigations, audits, deep dives, surveys, "let me check," "let me find" — if the purpose of a tool sequence is to find out something you don't yet know, it runs in a subagent. Renaming the activity does not change what it is. The subagent returns a distilled summary; the raw output stays in the subagent.

Inline tool use in the main context is reserved for reading a known file at a known path, edits and writes you're committing to, or a single targeted lookup whose result you'll act on immediately. If you find yourself running a second grep to refine the first, you should have spawned a subagent.

The main session holds only the durable artifacts you are producing: the edit, the commit, the doc update.

**Subagent model tiers:**
- Opus — design, architecture, any subagent that itself spawns subagents.
- Sonnet — implementation, mechanical multi-file work, default exploration.

## Durability

Subagent reports, mid-session realizations, "I'll remember this" — none of these outlast the session. Anything worth keeping goes into CLAUDE.md, code, docs, or a commit. If it isn't written down, it is gone.

**Commit completed work immediately.** After tests pass, commit. After each phase of a multi-phase plan, commit. Uncommitted work is lost work, and accumulated uncommitted phases lose isolation as well.

**Docs change in the same commit as the code.** New pages enter the sidebar in that commit. There is no follow-up.

Problems, tech debt, issues → TODO.md now, in the same response. Future/deferred scope → TODO.md **before** writing any code, not after. Code comments and conversation mentions are not tracked items.

## Authenticity

When asked to analyze X, read X. Do not synthesize from conversation memory, prior summaries, or what the file probably says. Claims must correspond to evidence produced this session.

**Something unexpected is a signal.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, a file containing what it shouldn't — stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.

**Verify before stating.** Don't assert API behavior or codebase facts without checking.

## Discipline

Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. A single correction does not warrant a CLAUDE.md edit. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly and the rule names the failure it prevents.

Do not announce actions ("I will now…"). Act.

**When stuck (2+ attempts):** Step back. Am I solving the right problem? Check docs/ before questioning design.

## Behavioral Patterns

From ecosystem-wide session analysis:

- **Question scope early:** Before implementing, ask whether it belongs in this crate/module
- **Check consistency:** Look at how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
- **Implement fully:** No silent arbitrary caps, incomplete pagination, or unexposed trait methods
- **Name for purpose:** Avoid names that describe one consumer

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test -q
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**Prefer `cargo test -q`** over `cargo test` — quiet mode only prints failures, significantly reducing output noise and context usage.

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**`normalize view` is available** for structural outlines of files and directories:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`. Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- No special cases — design to avoid them.
- No legacy APIs — one API, update all callers.
- No half measures — migrate ALL callers when adding abstraction.
- No premature "done" — note what remains.
